1. For every question that needs to read the given dataset, I used the following code to read the data from a certain file:
```python
    dir_data = os.listdir("/Users/lucifer.w/Documents/573/Assignment2/DataSet")
    os.chdir("/Users/lucifer.w/Documents/573/Assignment2/DataSet")
    for file in dir_data:
```
If you want to test it with another dataset, please change the dir_data.\
2. For all the sorting methods, part of my codes are original from the java codes provided in the course slides. I wrote the python codes based on those. All the sources that I refered to are listed in my code, please check it out.\
3. I used Excel to plot all the curve fitting figures. I only need to write the data into the excel and then plot the figure.
